# Functionalities

Functionalities is a collection packages for the backend and frontend that aims to make developers lives easier.

## Backend Packages:

- [@functionalities/mediakit](/packages/mediakit/README.md)

## Frontend Packages

A core principle for these packages is that they should be easy to use, accessibility first, and if suitable: configured primarily in HTML markup to reduce the weight of your JS bundle.
