# Web Components - v0.5.2

> Focused on accessibility, strictly markup and functionality/progressive enhancement. No styling unless necessary.

The Web Components library provides easy-to-use and simple solutions for common website features, with a strong focus on meeting accessibility standards and retaining as much functionality as possible in the case JS is disabled. All components included in this library adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA, providing a solid foundation for accessible web experiences.
